This is a simple web-based attendance calculator that helps you determine your attendance percentage based on the classes attended and conducted. It also provides information on the number of classes you can afford to skip to maintain a satisfactory attendance rate.

## Features

- Calculate attendance percentage for multiple subjects.
- Specify semester start and end dates.
- Input daily class schedules and holiday counts.
- Set attendance goals (Satisfactory or Condonation).
- The Formula for Calculating:
      -Attendance %= (Total Number of Classes Attended / Total Number of Classes Conducted) * 100
- Note: THIS PROGRAM CALCULATES THE NUMBER OF CLASSES YOU CAN SKIP AND THE ATTENDANCE PERCENTAGE FROM TOMORROW, SO MAKE SURE THE DATA YOU ENTER IS CONSIDERED FROM THE END OF TODAY

## How to Use

1. **Input Dates and Subjects**: Enter tomorrow's date, semester end date, and the number of subjects (up to 15).

2. **Create Input Boxes**: Click the "Enter Attendence" button to generate input fields for each subject to enter attended and conducted classes.

3. **Enter Daily Class and Holiday Counts**: Fill in the number of classes and holidays for each day of the week (Monday to Saturday).
